Analyze my table and give me a graph of the Top10 Shelters and their Average Occupancy

average_occupancy <- shelter_data %>%
  group_by(shelter_name) %>%
  summarize(average_occupancy = mean(occupancy, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(average_occupancy)) %>%
  top_n(10) 
ggplot(average_occupancy, aes(x = reorder(shelter_name, average_occupancy), y = average_occupancy, fill = shelter_name)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(x = "Shelter Name", y = "Average Occupancy", title = "Top 10 Shelters by Average Occupancy") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 


Draw the histgram of the top three and oranization

# Selecting the top 3 shelters
top_3_shelters <- head(average_occupancy, 3)
# Filtering the original data for only the top 3 shelters

Draw a diagram of the usage of the four types of people in the Sector in organizations

# First, let's filter the data to include only the four sectors mentioned.

# Now we will plot the use of organizations by these sectors.
